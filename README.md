# Curu-Beauty-App-Project-
Our Curu App Capstone Project aims to enhance a personalized skincare recommendation platform by addressing key challenges faced by the startup. 
Founded in 2021 by Rachael Thiel, Curu App currently struggles with limited customer reviews, a small product database of only 170 products, and insufficient user data for personalisation.
We focus on conducting comprehensive sentiment analysis and keyword extraction from external product reviews.
By analyzing customer feedback across various platforms, we intend to provide actionable insights that will help Curu App improve its recommendation algorithm, understand customer preferences, identify market trends, and ultimately enhance the overall user experience.
In our 12-week project we implemented web scraping, data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and potentially developing a dashboard to visualize our findings, supporting Curu App's goal of becoming a credible and user-friendly beauty recommendation platform.
